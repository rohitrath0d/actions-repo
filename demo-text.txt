error in redis with starting port 6379 - seems like docker has captured it coz it uses linux distribution via wsl


- Error solved:
- The Problem:
 - WinNAT (Windows Networking) reserved a range of ports that included 6379, blocking Docker from using it. This caused the "Access Forbidden" error.
-The Solution:
  - I manually forced Windows to release the port and then officially reserved it for Docker.
- Commands used (as Admin):
-> Remove stuck container: docker rm -f redis
-> Stop network service: net stop winnat
-> Reserve port 6379 for yourself:
  - netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange protocol=tcp startport=6379 numberofports=1
  - Restart network service: net start winnat
  - Start Redis: docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7
  - Check status: docker ps (Should now show 0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp)
